#ReadMe File for my Tic-Tac-Toe game.

To done ->
1 player or 2 player
Lets you replay
doesn't let you make illegal moves (in the right move format)
detects win/stalemates

To do ->
Make the AI a little smarter
  -make sure it checks to see if there is a winning move and actually takes it
  -prevent users from enter gibberish as moves
Fix the player 2 goes first after the first game bug
